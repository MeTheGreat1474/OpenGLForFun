A fun and experimental OpenGL playground for exploring graphics programming!  
This project is intended to help me learn and experiment with OpenGL concepts through hands-on coding.

## Features

- Custom window and rendering setup using GLFW and GLAD
- Shader loading and management
- Basic 2D and 3D rendering
- Texture support
- Real-time transformations
- Experimentation with colors, and shapes
- Basic mouse and keyboard movement
